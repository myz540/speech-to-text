# speech-to-text

## Motivation

I am a father of two little ones, one is three and half, the other is three months. The motivation behind this project stems from the fact that my wife and I both work remote and are currently juggling watching the three month old and working. He demands to be held all the time so it makes replying to emails, slack messages, and google searching more difficult. Obviously, I do not intend to use this tool to actually write/edit code, but it should allow easier 1-handed interactions with a computer
